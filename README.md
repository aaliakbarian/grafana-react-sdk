# Grafana React SDK

Render existing Grafana OSS dashboards as native React components.

No iframe.  
No Grafana application shell.

The project explores how a host application can select a Grafana dashboard by
UID and render it inside its own React interface while retaining ownership of
navigation, layout, authentication, and product chrome.

## Phase 0 result

**Gate C: PASS**

**Overall Phase 0 decision: REVISE**

The core architectural hypothesis succeeded: native Grafana panel rendering
without an iframe or the Grafana application shell is viable. The controlled
POC renders real Grafana OSS 13.2.3 panels through React 19.2.8 without calling
`GrafanaApp.init`.

`REVISE` does not mean the rendering architecture failed. It means the
production and distribution architecture requires further work before an SDK
can be released or supported. See the complete
[Phase 0 results](docs/architecture/research/poc-results.md).

## What works today

The disposable POC has demonstrated:

- dashboard retrieval by user-facing Grafana UID;
- stable V1/schema-42 dashboard DTO validation and constrained DTO-to-Scenes
  conversion;
- real Grafana Text panel rendering;
- a real Grafana TestData datasource and query path;
- real Grafana Stat and Time series rendering from query-backed data;
- time-range updates and manual refresh;
- responsive Time series resizing;
- UID changes, stale-work cancellation, and lifecycle cleanup;
- two compatible simultaneous dashboard instances sharing one runtime safely;
  and
- native React/DOM/canvas rendering with React and ReactDOM 19.2.8, no iframe,
  no Grafana application shell, and no `GrafanaApp.init`.

The controlled Time series comparison was visually close to the Grafana
reference, but the project does not claim pixel-perfect parity.

## Current POC boundary

Current support is intentionally constrained to:

- the exact Grafana OSS 13.2.3 baseline;
- a controlled current-schema V1/schema-42 dashboard fixture;
- Text, Stat, and Time series panels;
- the controlled built-in TestData datasource; and
- selected transformations required by the fixture.

The POC does not establish compatibility with arbitrary panels, plugins,
datasources, dashboard features, Grafana versions, or V2 dashboards. It is
evidence for a future SDK architecture, not a general compatibility promise.

## Why REVISE?

The production architecture still needs decisions and validation for:

- licensing and distribution of Grafana application source and assets;
- productizing or replacing the exact-version application-source bridge;
- the large bundle and inherited Monaco/editor closure;
- Grafana Runtime singleton ownership and page-level isolation;
- React 19 support while Scenes declares React 18 peers;
- containment of Grafana styling and global resets;
- exact Grafana-version coupling and upgrade strategy; and
- a scalable transformation-compatibility strategy.

These are technical and review checkpoints, not legal conclusions.

## Project boundaries

The intended SDK remains frontend-only. The host owns authentication, routing,
navigation, page chrome, and product-level error handling. The project will not
ship an SDK backend, reproduce Grafana navigation, or bootstrap the Grafana web
application shell.

## Run the POC

There is no SDK package to install. Contributors can run the private POC
workspaces, deterministic Grafana fixture, and verification suite through the
repository's container-first workflow. The host requires only Git, Docker with
Docker Compose, an editor, and the repository checkout.

See [Local development](docs/development/local-development.md) for setup and
commands.
